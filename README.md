# CommonCodeGenerators

![Logo](./logo.png)

Welcome to the CommonCodeGenerators project! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of code generators that can be used to streamline development processes in .NET applications.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the development phase. We are actively working on enhancing the functionality and adding new features.

## Projects

This repository contains two separate projects, each of which will be published as individual NuGet packages:

1. **Class Constructor Generator**: A code generator that automatically creates constructors for classes based on their fields and properties.
2. **Export Interface Generator**: A code generator that creates interfaces for classes, allowing for easier dependency injection and testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CommonCodeGenerators, clone the repository and explore the example projects included within. The example projects demonstrate how to utilize the code generators effectively.

### Prerequisites

- .NET Standard 2.0 or .NET 9
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/alperkonuralp/CommonSourceCodeGenerators`

2. Navigate to the project directory:<br/>
`cd ./CommonSourceCodeGenerators/src`

3. Build the projects:<br/>
`dotnet build`

## Usage

Refer to the example projects for detailed usage instructions. The examples showcase how to implement the code generators in your own projects.

### Class Constructor Generator

To use the Class Constructor Generator, follow the instructions in the `ClassConstructorGenerator` example project.

### Export Interface Generator

To use the Export Interface Generator, follow the instructions in the `ExportInterfaceGenerator` example project.
